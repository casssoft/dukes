DONE-Fix hasMet system to be more independent (maybe map of has done strings?)
DONE-Revisit dukeling dialog to make more sense
Make adding sprites more automatic (maybe get rid of sprite enum and just use string?)
Make royal more interesting
Consider putting clearing somewhere else...
Make scene system work a bit nicer, shouldn't be so hard to do branching


possible directions:
more people
more atmosphere
some form of progression
crazy trippiness
